# Comic-Tracker

## Summary 

When I first became a software engineer I struggled with the idea of building an application around a topic I was passionate about, as well one that could solve a simple problem with. As time went on and I finally found a problem I cared about: getting the current weeks comics.

So here's the thing it's already been done. Both Marvel and DC Comics have created mobile applications that list out their many comics and charcaters. However, that wasn't a reason to stop me from building this application. The main purpose of this application was for me to both build something that I was passionate about, and to challenge myself to solve a problem (regardless of whether it had already been solved).

So you may ask, "what actually is Comic-Tracker in it's current and working state?"

Comic-Tracker is peronally built web application with the main purpose of delivering both the current weeks comics, as well as the titular characers of them, to the user. The application's main and most important resource is the Marvel API, which it uses to grab data on the comics and characters. The the app also uses both React and Redux to handle a lot of that data, which being passed around between components and pages.

Some other notable features include:

- Being able to search characters, as well as favoriting them, allowing you to see their featured comics on the home page.

- Clicking on presented comics displays information on how much it is and who worked on it.

- Being able to save specific comics so that you can refrence for which ones to buy.

- Clicking on characters shows their information as well as featured comics.
